 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>Within the field of medicine, sports medicine and science is beginning to become more prominent. Although, the training for it and a clear career path can be challenging to find. In a culture and country that tends to obsess over sports, it seems ironic that the science around it is so challenging to find. Sports medicine is a growing field that students need to know how to access. By exploring the different approaches students take as undergraduates to prepare for their professional programs, it will help illuminate a more clear path for students who want to work in this emerging field.</p>

 <h2>Review of Existing Literature</h2>

 <h2>Rationale</h2>
 <p>This study will explore the different approaches students take as undergraduates in the United States. The information will assist students in understanding the best path to take to pursue a career in the growing field of sports medicine and science. Further, the education paths of current professionals within the field may shed some light on areas of study that undergraduate students need to pursue.</p>

 <h2>Method and Study Design</h2>
 <p>I would use interviews and participant surveys to collect data around the undergraduate studies of sports medicine. This is the best method to collect this data because many undergraduate students can be surveyed on the type of classes they are taking and their degrees. Therefore, the surveys would primarily be for these students. I would then use interviews to talk to professionals currently in the field about the type of undergraduate work they completed and what they recommend for students. From this, likely, I would only survey students pursuing the sports medicine field. I could do so by advertising the survey on a school website or having a link to the survey forwarded to all science students because they would be the most likely group pursuing that field. The survey would consist of a few basic questions such as:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>What is your major?</li>
    <li>What types of classes are you taking the most of?</li>
    <li>What are your career aspirations?</li>
    <li>What type of internships are you interested in? Or what types are you currently working in?</li>
    <li>What is your GPA?</li>
    <li>Do you personally feel successful?</li>
  </ul>
 <p>My interviews would then investigate in detail the steps that select individuals took to reach the position they are in today in sports medicine. The results of these surveys and interviews can be presented in the form of an article. First, it will include a summary of the surveys, analyzed using simple statistics like mean, median, and mode. This will be done by categorizing the results and graphing them using pie charts, which can also be displayed in the article. Alongside this, there will be some personal commentary and discussion of the results as to what the most common route is and the most successful. After this, transcripts of the interviews will be included in the article. They would likely be somewhere between intelligent and edited. Their purpose is to be precise but still very true to what the interviewee initially said. This topic does not have a hypothesis associated with it; instead, it is exploratory, and as a researcher, I am searching for an answer or at least more knowledge. Hence the conclusion will state my findings as to the most common, successful, and highly recommended undergraduate studies to complete when pursuing a career in sports medicine.</p>
