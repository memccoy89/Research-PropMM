 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>Within the field of medicine, sports medicine and science is beginning to become more prominent. Although, the training for it and a clear career path can be challenging to find. In a culture and country that tends to obsess over sports, it seems ironic that the science around it is so challenging to find. Sports medicine is a growing field that students need to know how to access. By exploring the different approaches students take as undergraduates to prepare for their professional programs, it will help illuminate a more clear path for students who want to work in this emerging field.</p>

 <h2>Rationale</h2>
 <p>This study will explore the different approaches students take as undergraduates in the United States. The information will assist students in understanding the best path to take to pursue a career in the growing field of sports medicine and science. Further, the education paths of current professionals within the field may shed some light on areas of study that undergraduate students need to pursue.</p>

 <h2>Method and Study Design</h2>
 <p>I would use interviews and participant surveys to collect data around the undergraduate studies of sports medicine. This is the best method to collect this data because many undergraduate students can be surveyed on the type of classes they are taking and their degrees. Therefore, the surveys would primarily be for these students. I would then use interviews to talk to professionals currently in the field about the type of undergraduate work they completed and what they recommend for students. From this, likely, I would only survey students pursuing the sports medicine field. I could do so by advertising the survey on a school website or having a link to the survey forwarded to all science students because they would be the most likely group pursuing that field. The survey would consist of a few basic questions such as:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>What is your major?</li>
    <li>What types of classes are you taking the most of?</li>
    <li>What are your career aspirations?</li>
    <li>What type of internships are you interested in? Or what types are you currently working in?</li>
    <li>What is your GPA?</li>
    <li>Do you personally feel successful?</li>
  </ul>
