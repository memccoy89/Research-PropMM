<h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>Within the field of medicine, sports medicine and science is beginning to become more prominent. Although, the training for it and a clear career path can be challenging to find. In a culture and country that tends to obsess over sports, it seems ironic that the science around it is so challenging to find. Sports medicine is a growing field that students need to know how to access. By exploring the different approaches students take as undergraduates to prepare for their professional programs, it will help illuminate a more clear path for students who want to work in this emerging field.</p>
