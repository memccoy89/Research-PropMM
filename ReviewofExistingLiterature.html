<h2>Review of Existing Literature</h2>
 <p>Current knowledge in the area revolves around the access to medicine and the differences in technique. There have also been studies that evaluate the quality of graduate studies in Europe. A prominent study is presented in the article, “The current state of orthopaedic residency in 18 European countries,” by Rami Madanat et al. Here, the differences in residency programs throughout 18 European countries are accounted for. This was done by administering a questionnaire to the Federation of Orthopaedic Trainees in Europe Representatives (FORTE). The resulting statistics covered differences in student to mentor ratios, duration, candidate selection and mandatory requirements (Madanat et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Another article, “International differences in sport medicine access and clinical management” follows researcher Neil Heron through the 2012 ECOSEP traveling fellowship. Written with corresponding author Nikolaos G. Malliaropoulos, it documents the differences in practice at five European sports medicine centers (Heron & Malliaropoulos, 2021).</p>
<p>In previous research, I’ve found the field to be less common in the United States, whereas in different countries across Europe, the field and training for it seemed more common and accessible. There is still minimal knowledge around what types of schooling undergraduate students complete in the US in comparison to European countries. This is an unmet aspect of the conversation that I would like to explore. To study the different ways students prepare themselves for graduate studies and their career path.</p>
